# Our General Approach 

## Data Clean Room

The full source code and summary is here: [Data Clean Room Task](https://github.com/akannan05/ges24)

We simply followed the instructions given in the prompt release as well as the TPM coding handout. 

We chose to use the Intel SGX (Software Guard Extensions), which prove hardware-level protection against privacy risks. While we were considering using some software solutions, such as Docker, we came to the conclusion that hardware protections would suffice. 

Our general structure was to use a Azure Virtual Machine with the Intel SGX capability. Then we have a separate resource called a Key Vault to save the public key's AK (Attestation Key). 

## Aggregate Statistics

The full visualizations and data analysis report is here: [Aggregate Statistics Task](https://github.com/akannan05/ges24/blob/main/Part%20II-Task%201/SUMMARY.md)

After merging and preprocessing the data, we used Pandas and Plotly to visualize the distributions and make statistical inferences. In addition to the given prompts, we also analyzed:
- jhlkj
- klkjkl
