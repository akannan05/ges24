# Part I: Data Clean Room, Privacy Preservation

## Data Clean Room

The goal is to create a Trusted Execution Environment where we can run the code on the datasets for the two parties. By running it in a DCR 

### Setup of Azure Virtual Machine for Trusted Execution Environment:

### Install and Setup SGX + Other Dependencies

### Setup Key Value Server in Microsoft Azure

### TPM Coding for Key Attestation

## Utilization

Here we run the code (which will be shown in Part 2) on both of our datasets to compare the results from running it in the TEE environment, and without any security.

### Predictive Model in TEE:

### Generative Model in TEE:
