## Age Distribution

We start by visualizing the age distribution with two separate pie charts.

![Age Potential](./img/Potential%20Customer%20Age%20Distribution.png)

![Age Non Potential](./img/Non-Potential%20Customer%20Age%20Distribution.png)

Interestingly, there's seem to be no major differences in the age distribution. We confirm this by comparing the distributions through a histogram.

## Gender Distribution

We then visualize the gender distribution between potential and non-potential customers using pie charts and grouped barcharts.

![image](./img/Non%20Customer%20Gender%20Dist.png)

![image](./img/Gender%20Grouped%20Barchart.png)

These plots show that there does not seem to be a noticeable difference in gender distribution among potential and non customers.

## Variable Residence

We then visualize the distribution of residence provinces among potential and non potential customers. We approached this with two pie charts:

After this, we plotted a grouped barplot to show the distributions side by side for seamless comparison!

These plots do not indicate any clear differences in distribution of residential provinces between potential and non potential customers.

## Variable Content Preference

Visualize the distributions of content preference among potential and non potential customers. We approached this task by creating two pie charts:

![image](https://github.com/akannan05/ges24/assets/70667502/1e2d4cdd-412f-47c4-aed2-8d7713ff2f56)

Created a grouped barplot to visualize the distribution differences more easily.

![image](https://github.com/akannan05/ges24/assets/70667502/c3adfc77-e29f-439c-aa14-f65540ffc7fc)

These plots show that potential customers seem to prefer content labeled 0 while non potential customers seem to prefer content labeled 1. Therefore, it may be wise to display more content labeled 0 as opposed to 1 in order to attract more customers.

## Variable Device Series

We started by visualizing the distributions of device series among potential and non potential customers. We approached this task by creating two pie charts:

![image](https://github.com/akannan05/ges24/assets/70667502/46d3ad9e-ab64-4af3-942b-c2483e3b5c84)

We then created a grouped barplot to visualize distribution differences more easily

![image](https://github.com/akannan05/ges24/assets/70667502/dd00ab29-ba05-40b5-acff-df95897c9a8c)

These plots do not indicate any key differences in distributions of device series among potential and non potential customers.

## Variable Device Series Group

We started by visualizing the distributions of device series group among potential and non potential customers. We approached this task by creating two pie charts:

![image](https://github.com/akannan05/ges24/assets/70667502/fe3ff3be-49e5-41ee-a1da-52b1ca3a08dc)
![image](https://github.com/akannan05/ges24/assets/70667502/03902c65-84a4-4c31-9df1-46069cef663e)

These plots do not indicate any key differences in distributions of device series groups among potential and non potential customers.

## Variable Device EMUI

We started by visualizing the distributions of device EMUI's among potential and non potential customers. We approached this task by creating two pie charts:

![image](https://github.com/akannan05/ges24/assets/70667502/294a683b-434e-4c1a-95c0-7257a680af3d)

![image](https://github.com/akannan05/ges24/assets/70667502/ffc16a3c-c99b-4c34-beb1-ddaf14b9c598)

These plots do not indicate any key differences in distributions of device series EMUI's among potential and non potential customers.

## Variable Advertisement Hour Viewed

We first created two pie charts to visualize the distribution of the hour at which ads were viewed among potential and non potential customers.

![image](https://github.com/akannan05/ges24/assets/70667502/447d6efa-4da0-409a-b0f6-8fa7ff814989)

We then used a grouped barplot to easily visualize the differences between the two distributions.

![image](https://github.com/akannan05/ges24/assets/70667502/24c929ea-2e82-45a9-99a9-3ea47e6c68b4)

These plots do not indicate any key differences in distributions of ad hour viewed among potential and non potential customers. We can see; however, that the most ads are viewed around the 9th and 10th hours of the day.

## Variable Feed Hour Viewed

We first created two pie charts to visualize the distribution of the hour at which feeds were viewed among potential and non potential customers.

![image](https://github.com/akannan05/ges24/assets/70667502/c14c4843-ec11-4b05-9c81-e45aa045ad02)

![image](https://github.com/akannan05/ges24/assets/70667502/6161004c-b7b2-4662-8685-ecaa25ad6ffd)

These plots show the distributions are fairly similar. There are some key takeaways from these visualizations though. THe 22nd hour of the day seems to be the most popular for viewing feeds seems to be the 22nd hour. Also, potential customers are more likely to view their feeds during the 19th hour as opposed to non-potential customers.


## Variable Advertisement Day Viewed

We first created two pie charts to visualize the distribution of the day at which ads were viewed among potential and non potential customers.

![image](https://github.com/akannan05/ges24/assets/70667502/6a5f7759-5dc6-456e-ba60-5a8c4bc634d5)

![image](https://github.com/akannan05/ges24/assets/70667502/63aeb8da-7ca1-4eab-8f3b-35d7d46cb784)

The plots show that potential customers clearly tend to progress further through the articles than non-potential customers.
