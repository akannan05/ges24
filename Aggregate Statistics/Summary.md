# Aggregate Statistics and Data Visualizations

## Explore differences in variable distributions between Potential Customers (people who clicked on ads) and Non-Potential Customers (people who did not click on ads)

### Variable Age:

- We started by visualizing the age distribution with two separate pie charts. One for potential customers, and one for non-potential customers.

- After this, we plotted a grouped barplot showing the distributions side by side for easy comparison.

- These plots show that there does not seem to be a noticeable difference in age distributions among potential and non customers.

### Variable Gender:


- We started by visualizing the gender distribution with two separate pie charts. One for potential customers, and one for non-potential customers.

- These plots show that there does not seem to be a noticeable difference in gender distribution among potential and non customers.

### Variable Residence

- We started by visualizing the distribution of residence provinces among potential and non potential customers. We approached this with two pie charts:

- After this, we plotted a grouped barplot to show the distributions side by side for seamless comparison!

- These plots do not indicate any clear differences in distribution of residential provinces between potential and non potential customers.


### Variable Content Preference

- We started by visualizing the distributions of content preference among potential and non potential customers. We approached this task by creating two pie charts:

- We then created a grouped barplot to visualize the distribution differences more easily.

- These plots show that potential customers seem to prefer content labeled 0 while non potential customers seem to prefer content labeled 1. Therefore, it may be wise to display more content labeled 0 as opposed to 1 in order to attract more customers.


### Variable Device Series


- We started by visualizing the distributions of device series among potential and non potential customers. We approached this task by creating two pie charts:

- We then created a grouped barplot to visualize distribution differences more easily

- These plots do not indicate any key differences in distributions of device series among potential and non potential customers.
