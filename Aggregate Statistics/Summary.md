# Aggregate Statistics and Data Visualizations

## Explore differences in variable distributions between Potential Customers (people who clicked on ads) and Non-Potential Customers (people who did not click on ads)

### Variable Age:

- We started by visualizing the age distribution with two separate pie charts. One for potential customers, and one for non-potential customers.

- After this, we plotted a grouped barplot showing the distributions side by side for easy comparison.

- These plots show that there does not seem to be a noticeable difference in age distributions among potential and non customers.

### Variable Gender:


- We started by visualizing the gender distribution with two separate pie charts. One for potential customers, and one for non-potential customers.

- These plots show that there does not seem to be a noticeable difference in gender distribution among potential and non customers.

### Variable Residence

- We started by visualizing the distribution of residence provinces among potential and non potential customers. We approached this with two pie charts:

- After this, we plotted a grouped barplot to show the distributions side by side for seamless comparison!

- These plots do not indicate any clear differences in distribution of residential provinces between potential and non potential customers.


### Variable Content Preference

- We started by visualizing the distributions of content preference among potential and non potential customers. We approached this task by creating two pie charts:

- These plots show that potential customers seem to prefer content labeled 0 while non potential customers seem to prefer content labeled 1. Therefore, it may be wise to display more content labeled 0 as opposed to 1 in order to attract more customers.


### Variable Device Series


- We started by visualizing the distributions of device series among potential and non potential customers. We approached this task by creating two pie charts:

![image](https://github.com/akannan05/ges24/assets/70667502/46d3ad9e-ab64-4af3-942b-c2483e3b5c84)

![image](https://github.com/akannan05/ges24/assets/70667502/dd00ab29-ba05-40b5-acff-df95897c9a8c)

- These plots do not indicate any key differences in distributions of device series among potential and non potential customers.


### Variable Device Series Group

- We started by visualizing the distributions of device series group among potential and non potential customers. We approached this task by creating two pie charts:

- These plots do not indicate any key differences in distributions of device series groups among potential and non potential customers.



### Variable Device EMUI

- We started by visualizing the distributions of device EMUI's among potential and non potential customers. We approached this task by creating two pie charts:

![image](https://github.com/akannan05/ges24/assets/70667502/294a683b-434e-4c1a-95c0-7257a680af3d)

- These plots do not indicate any key differences in distributions of device series EMUI's among potential and non potential customers.



### Variable Advertisement Hour Viewed

- We first created two pie charts to visualize the distribution of the hour at which ads were viewed among potential and non potential customers.

- These plots do not indicate any key differences in distributions of ad hour viewed among potential and non potential customers. We can see; however, that the most ads are viewed around the 9th and 10th hours of the day.



### Variable Feed Hour Viewed

- We first created two pie charts to visualize the distribution of the hour at which feeds were viewed among potential and non potential customers.

![image](https://github.com/akannan05/ges24/assets/70667502/c14c4843-ec11-4b05-9c81-e45aa045ad02)

- These plots show the distributions are fairly similar. There are some key takeaways from these visualizations though. THe 22nd hour of the day seems to be the most popular for viewing feeds seems to be the 22nd hour. Also, potential customers are more likely to view their feeds during the 19th hour as opposed to non-potential customers.


### Variable Advertisement Day Viewed

- We first created two pie charts to visualize the distribution of the day at which ads were viewed among potential and non potential customers.

- The plots show no clear differences in distributions of ad day viewed among potential and non potential customers. We can see that most ads are viewed during the weekend (Friday-Sunday) with a majority being viewed on Friday.


### Variable Feed Day Viewed

- We first created two pie charts to visualize the distribution of the day at which feeds were viewed among potential and non potential customers.

- The plots show no clear differences in distributions of ad day viewed among potential and non potential customers, except for the fact that potential customers tend to view feeds more on Wednesday compared to non-potential customers.
